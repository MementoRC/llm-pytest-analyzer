# Disaster Recovery Plan

This document outlines the disaster recovery strategy for the `pytest-analyzer` project, ensuring business continuity and rapid restoration in the event of failures or incidents.

---

## 1. Recovery Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** < 2 hours for critical services
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** < 15 minutes for configuration and state

## 2. Backup Strategy

- Regularly back up:
  - Configuration files (`.pytest-analyzer.yaml`, `.pytest-analyzer.json`)
  - Persistent cache/state (if using Redis or disk cache)
  - Test result archives and reports
- Store backups in a secure, offsite location or cloud storage.
- Automate backup schedules and test restoration quarterly.

## 3. Restoration Procedures

1. **Identify Incident:** Detect failure via monitoring or user report.
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine affected components (analyzer, cache, config, etc.).
3. **Restore from Backup:**
   - Retrieve latest backup of configuration and state.
   - Restore files to the appropriate project or server location.
   - Validate integrity and permissions.
4. **Restart Services:** Restart the analyzer and any dependent services.
5. **Verify Recovery:** Run health checks and sample analyses to confirm restoration.

## 4. Failover and Redundancy

- Deploy redundant analyzer instances in production for high availability.
- Use managed Redis or database services with built-in failover if applicable.
- Document and test failover procedures.

## 5. Incident Response

- Log all incidents and recovery actions.
- Notify stakeholders and escalate as needed.
- Conduct a post-mortem to identify root causes and improve processes.

## 6. Security Considerations

- Encrypt all backups at rest and in transit.
- Restrict access to backup and recovery systems.
- Rotate backup credentials and audit access logs.
