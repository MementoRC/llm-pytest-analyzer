# Project Retrospective: pytest-analyzer

This retrospective documents the journey, challenges, and lessons learned during the development of the `pytest-analyzer` project.

---

## 1. What Went Well

- **Modular Architecture:** The adoption of a protocol-based, DI-driven architecture enabled rapid iteration and maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Security:** Early and repeated security audits led to robust input validation, path handling, and secret management.
- **Documentation-Driven Development:** Maintaining up-to-date documentation improved onboarding and knowledge transfer.
- **Community Feedback:** User and contributor feedback directly shaped features and usability.

## 2. Challenges

- **Subprocess Security:** Ensuring safe git and shell operations required significant refactoring and validation.
- **Environment Manager Detection:** Supporting multiple Python environment managers with auto-detection and caching was complex.
- **LLM Integration:** Balancing rule-based and LLM-based suggestions, and handling API limits, required careful design.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintaining a stable API while refactoring for modularity and testability was non-trivial.

## 3. Lessons Learned

- **Security is Ongoing:** Security must be integrated from the start and revisited regularly.
- **Automate Everything:** Automated testing, security scanning, and documentation builds are essential for quality and velocity.
- **Design for Extensibility:** Protocols, DI, and clear interfaces make it easier to add new features and integrations.
- **Value of Retrospectives:** Regular reviews and post-mortems help catch issues early and foster a culture of improvement.

## 4. Recommendations for Future Projects

- Invest in security and documentation from day one.
- Use dependency injection and protocol-based design for all major components.
- Prioritize testability and automation.
- Engage the user community early and often.
