# Security Practices Guide

This guide summarizes the security practices for developers and operators of `pytest-analyzer`, based on the latest security audits and recommendations.

---

## 1. Exception Handling and SecurityError Usage

- Use the `SecurityError` exception for all security-related failures.
- Never silently ignore exceptions in security-sensitive code; always log security events.
- Integrate security logging and monitoring for all authentication, authorization, and file access events.

## 2. Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs, including CLI arguments, API payloads, and file paths.
- Use schema-based validation for complex data (e.g., JSON).
- Sanitize all inputs before use, especially those passed to subprocesses or file operations.

## 3. Subprocess and File Operations

- Avoid shell=True in subprocess calls.
- Use strict input validation and `shlex.quote()` for all arguments passed to subprocesses.
- Prefer using libraries (e.g., GitPython) over raw subprocess calls for git operations.
- Always validate and sanitize file paths to prevent path traversal and symlink attacks.

## 4. Dependency and Supply Chain Security

- Pin all dependencies and use lock files with checksums.
- Run regular dependency vulnerability scans (e.g., with Safety).
- Review and approve dependency updates.
- Audit AI API usage for data leakage risks.

## 5. Authentication and Authorization

- Enforce token-based authentication for all sensitive operations.
- Implement role-based access control and fine-grained permissions.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts in production.
- Log all authentication and authorization events.

## 6. Secret Management

- Never store secrets in code or configuration files.
- Use a dedicated secret management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
- Rotate secrets regularly and audit access.

## 7. Configuration Security

- Use secure-by-default configuration.
- Validate all configuration files and environment variables.
- Document all security-related configuration options.

## 8. Security Testing and Monitoring

- Include security tests for input validation, injection prevention, and access control.
- Integrate static analysis (Bandit), dependency scanning (Safety), and dynamic testing (OWASP ZAP) into CI/CD.
- Monitor audit logs and set up alerts for suspicious activity.

## 9. Incident Response

- Maintain a documented incident response plan.
- Retain audit logs for at least 90 days.
- Review and update security policies quarterly.
