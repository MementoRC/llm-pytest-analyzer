# Task ID: 3
# Title: Integrate PytestAnalyzerService for Test Execution
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the existing PytestAnalyzerService with the GUI to enable test execution directly from the interface.
# Details:
Connect the TestExecutionController to the existing PytestAnalyzerService. Implement methods to:
- Discover available tests in a project
- Execute selected tests
- Capture test output in real-time
- Track test execution progress
- Handle test execution errors

Use the background task system to run tests without blocking the UI. Implement proper signal connections to update the UI with test progress and results.

# Test Strategy:
Test integration with PytestAnalyzerService using mock test suites. Verify test discovery, execution, and result capture. Test error handling during test execution. Ensure progress tracking accurately reflects test execution state.
