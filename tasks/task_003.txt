# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Pixi Environment Manager
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a concrete implementation of the Environment Manager protocol for Pixi
# Details:
Implement the Pixi environment manager class that conforms to the EnvironmentManager protocol:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List
import subprocess

from .protocol import EnvironmentManager

class PixiManager:
    @classmethod
    def detect(cls, project_path: Path) -> bool:
        """Detect if Pixi is used in the project"""
        return (project_path / "pixi.toml").exists()

    def __init__(self, project_path: Path):
        self.project_path = project_path

    def build_command(self, command: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        """Build a command with proper Pixi environment context"""
        return ["pixi", "run"] + command

    def execute_command(self, command: List[str]) -> int:
        """Execute a command within the Pixi environment"""
        full_command = self.build_command(command)
        return subprocess.call(full_command, cwd=self.project_path)

    def activate(self) -> None:
        """Activate the Pixi environment (not typically needed as pixi run handles this)"""
        pass

    def deactivate(self) -> None:
        """Deactivate the Pixi environment"""
        pass
```

Ensure the implementation correctly handles Pixi-specific command execution patterns and environment activation.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests that verify the Pixi manager correctly detects Pixi projects, builds commands properly, and executes commands in the Pixi environment. Mock subprocess calls to verify correct command construction. Test with actual Pixi projects in integration tests.
