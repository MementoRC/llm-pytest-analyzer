# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Background Task Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a background task management system using Qt QThread to handle long-running operations without freezing the UI.
# Details:
Implement a TaskManager class that handles background processing using Qt's QThread mechanism. Include:
- Task queue management
- Progress reporting through Qt signals/slots
- Cancellation support for long-running operations
- Error handling and user feedback
- Thread-safe communication with the main UI thread

Create a WorkerThread class that can execute arbitrary tasks and report progress. Implement proper thread synchronization and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test thread creation, task execution, progress reporting, and cancellation. Verify thread safety with concurrent operations. Test error handling and recovery. Ensure UI remains responsive during long-running tasks.
