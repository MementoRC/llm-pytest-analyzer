# Task ID: 2
# Title: Add MCP SDK Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the MCP Python SDK as a project dependency with proper version management in pyproject.toml.
# Details:
Update `pyproject.toml` to include:
1. Add MCP Python SDK as an optional dependency
2. Create a new optional dependency group for MCP server functionality
3. Set appropriate version constraints
4. Ensure no conflicts with existing dependencies
5. Update development dependencies for testing MCP functionality

Example addition to pyproject.toml:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
mcp = [
    "mcp-python-sdk>=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
    "fastapi>=0.95.0,<1.0.0",  # For HTTP transport
    "uvicorn>=0.22.0,<1.0.0",  # For HTTP transport
]
```

Run dependency resolution tests to ensure compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verify dependency installation with `pip install -e ".[mcp]"`. Test importing MCP SDK in Python. Check for any dependency conflicts or warnings. Ensure development environment can be set up with new dependencies.
