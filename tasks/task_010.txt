# Description: Update project documentation to include information about environment manager detection and create examples for each supported manager
# Details:
Update the project documentation to include information about the environment manager detection feature:

1. Update README.md with a new section on environment manager support

## Environment Manager Support

pytest-analyzer now automatically detects and integrates with your project's Python environment manager:

- **Pixi**: Automatically detected via `pixi.toml`
- **Poetry**: Automatically detected via `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.poetry]`
- **Hatch**: Automatically detected via `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.hatch]`
- **UV**: Automatically detected via `uv.lock` or UV configuration in `pyproject.toml`
- **Pipenv**: Automatically detected via `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock`
- **Pip+Venv**: Automatically detected via `requirements.txt` with virtual environment

### Manual Override

You can manually specify which environment manager to use:

```bash
# Via CLI flag
pytest-analyzer --env-manager poetry

# Via configuration file (.pytest-analyzer.json)
{
  "environment_manager": "poetry"
}

# Via environment variable
PYTEST_ANALYZER_ENV_MANAGER=poetry pytest-analyzer
```
```

Create example projects for each environment manager in the `examples/` directory to demonstrate usage.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for accuracy and completeness. Test examples to ensure they work correctly with each environment manager. Conduct user testing to verify that the documentation is clear and helpful.
