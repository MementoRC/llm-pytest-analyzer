# Details:
Implement a fix suggestion display with:

- Navigation between multiple suggestions
- Suggestion ranking/scoring display

Use a custom widget combining QTextEdit and a diff viewer component. Implement syntax highlighting using QSyntaxHighlighter. Connect to the AnalysisController to receive fix suggestions.
