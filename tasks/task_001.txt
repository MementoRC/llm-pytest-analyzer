# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Project Architecture Document
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive architecture document outlining the new structure, component relationships, and interfaces based on the refactoring requirements.
# Details:
The architecture document should include:
1. Component diagram showing the relationships between Extractors, Analyzers, Suggesters, Appliers, and LLM Services
2. Interface definitions for each component using Python's Protocol type
3. Data flow diagrams
4. Dependency injection approach
5. Error handling strategy
6. State machine design

The document should serve as a reference for the entire refactoring process and ensure all team members have a clear understanding of the target architecture.

# Test Strategy:
Review the document with stakeholders to ensure it addresses all requirements in the PRD. Validate that the proposed architecture supports all current functionality while enabling the improvements specified in the project goals.
