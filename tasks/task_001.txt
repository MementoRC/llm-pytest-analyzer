# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Controller Architecture
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the controller directory structure and implement the base controller classes to establish proper MVC architecture.
# Details:
Create the controllers directory with the following files:
- main_controller.py: Main application orchestration
- test_execution_controller.py: Test running and progress
- analysis_controller.py: LLM analysis coordination
- fix_controller.py: Fix suggestion and application
- file_controller.py: File operations and project management
- settings_controller.py: Configuration management

Implement a BaseController class with common functionality and have each specific controller inherit from it. Ensure proper signal/slot connections between controllers and views. Move existing logic from MainWindow into appropriate controllers.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each controller using pytest and Qt Test framework. Mock dependencies to isolate controller logic. Verify signal emissions and slot connections. Test controller initialization and proper separation of concerns.
