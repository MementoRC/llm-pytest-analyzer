# Description: Create an embedded code editor for viewing and modifying code with syntax highlighting.
# Details:
Implement an embedded code editor with:
- Python syntax highlighting
- Line numbering
- Code folding
- Search and replace functionality
- Undo/redo support

Use QScintilla or a similar advanced editor component. Implement proper file loading and saving. Connect to the FileController for file operations. Support both viewing and editing modes.

# Test Strategy:
Test editor functionality with various Python files. Verify syntax highlighting accuracy. Test file loading and saving. Ensure proper handling of large files without performance issues.
