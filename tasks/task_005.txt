# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Environment Manager Detection into CLI Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the existing CLI module to use the environment manager detection service for command execution
# Details:
Modify the existing CLI module to use the environment manager detection service:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Optional

from .detection import EnvironmentManagerDetector
from .protocol import EnvironmentManager

class CLI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.detector = EnvironmentManagerDetector()
        self.current_manager: Optional[EnvironmentManager] = None

    def initialize(self, project_path: Path) -> None:
        """Initialize the CLI with the appropriate environment manager"""
        self.current_manager = self.detector.detect(project_path)

    def execute_command(self, command: list[str], project_path: Path) -> int:
        """Execute a command using the appropriate environment manager"""
        if not self.current_manager:
            self.initialize(project_path)

        if self.current_manager:
            return self.current_manager.execute_command(command)
        else:
            # Fall back to direct execution if no environment manager is detected
            import subprocess
            return subprocess.call(command, cwd=project_path)
```

Ensure that the CLI maintains backward compatibility with existing behavior while adding the new environment manager detection functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the CLI module with mocked environment managers. Test initialization and command execution with different environment managers. Test fallback behavior when no environment manager is detected. Create integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality with real commands.
