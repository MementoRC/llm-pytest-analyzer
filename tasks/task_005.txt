# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Test Execution Progress Tracking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a progress tracking interface to display real-time test execution status.
# Details:
Implement a progress tracking UI with:
- Overall progress bar showing test execution percentage
- Current test name display
- Elapsed time and estimated time remaining
- Test counts (passed, failed, skipped)
- Cancel button for stopping test execution

Connect progress tracking to signals from the TestExecutionController. Update the UI in real-time as tests execute. Implement proper state management for test execution status.

# Test Strategy:
Test progress updates with mock test execution. Verify accuracy of progress calculation. Test cancellation functionality. Ensure UI updates correctly with rapid test execution.
