# Task ID: 9
# Title: Update Test Execution and Quality Validation Workflows
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify existing test execution and quality validation workflows to use the detected environment manager
# Details:
Update the test execution and quality validation workflows to use the environment manager detection:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List, Optional

from .cli import CLI

class TestExecutor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cli = CLI()

    def initialize(self, project_path: Path) -> None:
        """Initialize the test executor with the appropriate environment manager"""
        self.cli.initialize(project_path)

    def run_tests(self, test_paths: List[str], project_path: Path, options: List[str] = None) -> int:
        """Run pytest with the appropriate environment manager"""
        if options is None:
            options = []

        command = ["pytest"] + options + test_paths
        return self.cli.execute_command(command, project_path)

    def run_linter(self, paths: List[str], project_path: Path, options: List[str] = None) -> int:
        """Run ruff with the appropriate environment manager"""
        if options is None:
            options = []

        command = ["ruff", "check"] + options + paths
        return self.cli.execute_command(command, project_path)

    def run_pre_commit(self, project_path: Path) -> int:
        """Run pre-commit with the appropriate environment manager"""
        command = ["pre-commit", "run", "--all-files"]
        return self.cli.execute_command(command, project_path)
```

Ensure that all quality validation commands are executed within the correct environment context.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the test executor with mocked CLI and environment managers. Test that commands are correctly built and executed for different quality tools. Create integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality with real commands and environment managers.
