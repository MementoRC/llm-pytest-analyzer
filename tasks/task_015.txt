# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Settings Dialog
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive settings dialog for configuring application preferences.
# Details:
Implement a settings dialog with sections for:
- LLM provider configuration (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- API keys and authentication
- Test execution settings (timeout, parallel execution)
- GUI preferences (theme, layout)
- Git integration settings

Use QSettings for persistent storage. Implement validation for required settings. Create a clean, organized UI with tabs or categories. Connect to the SettingsController for managing configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test settings persistence across application restarts. Verify validation of required fields. Test loading and applying settings. Ensure proper handling of sensitive data like API keys.
