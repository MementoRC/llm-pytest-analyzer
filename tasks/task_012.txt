# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Side-by-Side Diff View
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a side-by-side diff view to compare original code with suggested fixes.
# Details:
Implement a diff view component with:
- Side-by-side comparison of original and modified code
- Highlighting of added, removed, and modified lines
- Line linking between corresponding sections
- Navigation between changes
- Apply/reject buttons for individual changes

Use two synchronized code editors with custom highlighting for changes. Implement diff algorithm or integrate with existing diff library. Connect to the FixController for applying changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test diff rendering with various code changes. Verify highlighting accuracy. Test navigation between changes. Ensure proper synchronization between the two editor views.
