# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate LLMSuggester for Failure Analysis
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the existing LLMSuggester component to analyze test failures.
# Details:
Implement the AnalysisController to:
- Connect to the existing LLMSuggester components
- Trigger automatic analysis of failed tests
- Handle LLM API communication in background threads
- Process and store analysis results
- Handle API errors and rate limiting

Use the background task system to perform analysis without blocking the UI. Implement caching to avoid redundant API calls. Handle authentication and API key management securely.

# Test Strategy:
Test integration with LLMSuggester using mock failures. Verify API communication and error handling. Test caching mechanism for repeated analyses. Ensure proper handling of rate limits and API errors.
