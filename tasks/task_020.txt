# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Polishing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize performance and polish the UI for production readiness.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations:
- Lazy loading of UI components
- Caching of expensive operations
- Memory usage optimization
- UI responsiveness improvements
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility

Conduct performance profiling to identify bottlenecks. Implement optimizations for identified issues. Add final polish to UI components. Ensure consistent styling and behavior across the application.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance testing with large projects and test suites. Measure and verify improvements in key metrics. Test memory usage under sustained operation. Ensure UI remains responsive during all operations.
