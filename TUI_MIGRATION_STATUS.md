# TUI Migration Status

## Current Focus: Rich/Textual TUI Migration

**Last Updated**: Today  
**Phase**: Architecture Analysis ‚Üí Rich/Textual Research

## Quick Context for Restart

### Problem Statement
- PyQt6/PySide6 GUI crashes on second test execution due to Qt memory management bugs
- Need stable TUI alternative for developer workflows

### Architecture Assessment ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Core-GUI Separation**: Already achieved - `src/pytest_analyzer/core/` has zero Qt dependencies
- **Rich Integration**: Already present - CLI and core services use Rich progress bars
- **MVC Architecture**: Clean controller pattern ready for TUI adaptation
- **Background Tasks**: TaskManager can be adapted for async TUI event loops

### Current Task Status
Use `TodoRead` tool in Claude Code to see current migration task status.

**Key Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Analyze GUI architecture and dependencies 
2. ‚è≥ Research Rich/Textual TUI frameworks and design interface
3. üìã Extract core logic from GUI dependencies (minimal work needed)
4. üìã Implement Rich/Textual TUI views
5. üìã Create TUI event handling system
6. üìã Validate TUI functionality

### Key Files for Migration
- `gui_migration_proposals.md` - Full strategy document
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with TUI migration focus
- `src/pytest_analyzer/core/` - Core services (no changes needed)
- `src/pytest_analyzer/gui/controllers/` - Logic to adapt for TUI
- `src/pytest_analyzer/gui/views/` - Components to reimplement with Rich/Textual

### Next Steps
1. Continue Rich/Textual framework research and TUI interface design
2. Create TUI prototype with Rich widgets
3. Implement event system to replace Qt signals/slots
4. Validate workflow functionality in TUI

### Migration Benefits
- No Qt framework dependencies
- Lightweight, fast interface
- Perfect for developer command-line workflows
- Leverages existing Rich integration
- Core services require zero changes
