# GUI Enhancement PRD: Complete Test Execution and Analysis Workflow

## Executive Summary

The pytest-analyzer GUI currently provides excellent test result visualization but lacks the core functionality to execute tests, analyze failures with LLM, and apply suggested fixes. This PRD outlines the enhancements needed to create a complete test-to-fix workflow in the GUI.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Strengths
- Solid MVC architecture foundation with proper Qt6 implementation
- Excellent test results visualization and navigation
- Comprehensive data models for test results and failures
- File selection and report parsing capabilities
- Clean UI layout with proper menu/toolbar structure

### Critical Gaps
- No test execution engine integration
- Missing LLM analysis capabilities
- No fix suggestion and application workflow
- Empty controllers directory (logic embedded in MainWindow)
- No settings management interface
- Missing background task management

## Product Vision

Transform the pytest-analyzer GUI from a passive results viewer into a complete test-driven development assistant that can:
1. Execute pytest tests with real-time progress tracking
2. Automatically analyze failures using LLM services
3. Suggest and apply fixes to failing tests
4. Provide a seamless workflow from test failure to resolution

## Technical Architecture

### Controller Implementation
Create proper MVC controllers to separate business logic:

```
controllers/
├── main_controller.py           # Main application orchestration
├── test_execution_controller.py # Test running and progress
├── analysis_controller.py       # LLM analysis coordination
├── fix_controller.py            # Fix suggestion and application
├── file_controller.py           # File operations and project management
└── settings_controller.py       # Configuration management
```

### Integration Points
- **PytestAnalyzerService**: Core test execution and analysis
- **AnalyzerStateMachine**: Workflow state management
- **LLMSuggester**: AI-powered failure analysis
- **FixApplier**: Code modification and Git integration
- **ConfigurationManager**: Settings and configuration

### Background Task Management
- Implement Qt QThread-based background processing
- Progress reporting through Qt signals/slots
- Cancellation support for long-running operations
- Error handling and user feedback

## User Experience Flow

### Primary Workflow
1. **Project Setup**: User selects project directory
2. **Test Discovery**: System discovers available tests
3. **Test Selection**: User selects tests to run (optional)
4. **Test Execution**: Tests run with progress tracking
5. **Failure Analysis**: Failed tests are automatically analyzed
6. **Fix Review**: User reviews suggested fixes
7. **Fix Application**: User applies selected fixes
8. **Re-testing**: User re-runs tests to verify fixes

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of test execution failures
- LLM service connection errors
- File system permission issues
- Invalid configuration scenarios

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- Test execution success rate
- LLM analysis accuracy
