# Pytest-Analyzer Refactoring Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview
The pytest-analyzer is a tool for analyzing pytest test failures, suggesting fixes, and automatically applying them. This project focuses on refactoring the codebase to improve architecture, testability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Problem Statement
The current implementation has several architectural issues:
1. Tight coupling between components
2. Lack of clear separation of concerns
3. No dependency injection, making testing difficult
4. Poor error handling and logging
5. Inconsistent interfaces and implementations
6. Complex state management

## Project Goals
1. Implement proper dependency injection throughout the codebase
2. Create clear interfaces using protocols
3. Establish a consistent error handling mechanism
4. Improve logging and telemetry
5. Create both synchronous and asynchronous APIs where needed
6. Implement the State Machine pattern for complex processes
7. Enhance test coverage and quality
8. Improve code organization and modularity

## Technical Requirements

### Architectural Changes
1. **Dependency Injection**: Implement DI throughout the codebase to allow for more modular components that can be easily tested and replaced.
2. **Protocol Interfaces**: Create clear interfaces using Python's Protocol type for component contracts.
3. **Component Separation**: Ensure clear separation between:
   - Extractors (parse test results)
   - Analyzers (analyze test failures)
   - Suggesters (suggest fixes)
   - Appliers (apply fixes)
   - LLM Services (communicate with language models)

### LLM Service Refactoring
1. Create a proper LLM service with configuration and resource management injected
2. Implement both synchronous and asynchronous API methods
3. Create a PromptBuilder component for constructing prompts
4. Create a ResponseParser component for parsing responses
5. Add proper error handling with context managers
6. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

### State Machine Implementation
1. Create a state machine base class for managing complex processes
2. Implement an analyzer state machine for the test analysis workflow
3. Ensure the state machine is testable and can be easily extended
4. Handle errors and transitions properly

### Testing Improvements
1. Increase test coverage, especially for error cases
2. Improve test organization
3. Create more focused unit tests with proper mocking
4. Add integration tests for major workflows

### Documentation and Logging
1. Improve code documentation with proper docstrings
2. Enhance logging with consistent levels and messages
3. Add telemetry for important operations
4. Create clear examples for API usage

## Success Criteria
1. All tests pass with improved code organization
2. Increased test coverage (goal: 80%+)
3. Clear separation of concerns with interfaces
4. Improved error handling
5. Both synchronous and asynchronous APIs available
6. Backward compatibility with existing code
7. Documentation updated to reflect architectural changes
