# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Code Review, Cleanup, and Security Hardening

## Project Overview

### Background
The pytest-analyzer project recently experienced a critical SecurityError issue that was hidden in the codebase and not detected by the extensive test suite. This indicates systemic issues with code organization, error handling visibility, and security practices that need immediate attention.

### Objective
Perform a comprehensive code review, cleanup, and improvement initiative to enhance code quality, security, maintainability, and adherence to best practices without changing core functionality.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Hidden Security Vulnerabilities**: SecurityError was present but not detected by tests
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Critical errors may be silently caught or improperly handled
3. **Code Organization**: Potential structural issues that hide problems
4. **Testing Gaps**: Test suite didn't catch critical security issues
5. **Code Quality Inconsistencies**: Varying standards across modules

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities hidden from detection
- **Medium Risk**: Maintenance burden due to code organization issues
- **Medium Risk**: Future development velocity impacted by technical debt
- **Low Risk**: Developer onboarding complexity

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Zero Hidden Security Issues**: All security-related code paths visible and properly tested
2. **Comprehensive Error Visibility**: All exceptions properly logged, handled, and tested
3. **Consistent Code Standards**: Uniform coding standards across entire codebase
4. **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Critical paths, especially security-related, fully covered
5. **Improved Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns and dependency management

### Quality Gates
- All existing functionality preserved (zero functional regressions)
- Test suite passes with enhanced coverage
- Static analysis tools report zero critical issues
- Security audit passes with no high/medium vulnerabilities
- Code review checklist 100% satisfied
