# This is a placeholder uv.lock file.
# In a real project, this would be generated by `uv pip compile` or `uv lock`.
# Its mere presence is enough for pytest-analyzer to detect UV as a potential manager.
# For a functional lock file, you would typically have content like:
# {
#   "version": 1,
#   "requires_python": ">=3.9",
#   "dependencies": {
#     "pytest": {
#       "version": "7.4.0",
#       "dependencies": { ... }
#     }
#   }
# }
